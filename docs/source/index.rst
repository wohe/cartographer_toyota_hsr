   :hidden:

`Cartographer`_ is a system that provides real-time simultaneous localization
and mapping `SLAM`_ across multiple platforms and sensor configurations. This
repository provides Cartographer SLAM for the `Toyota HSR`_ via
`Cartographer ROS`_.

Building & Installation
=======================

Installation has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) with ROS Indigo, but may
also work on Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) with ROS Kinetic. We recommend using
`wstool <http://wiki.ros.org/wstool>`_ and
`rosdep <http://wiki.ros.org/rosdep>`_. For faster builds, we also recommend
using `Ninja <https://ninja-build.org>`_.

  .. code-block:: bash

    # Install wstool and rosdep.
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y python-wstool python-rosdep ninja-build

    # Create a new workspace in 'catkin_ws'.
    mkdir catkin_ws
    cd catkin_ws
    wstool init

    # Merge the cartographer_ros rosinstall file and fetch code for dependencies.
    wstool merge https://raw.githubusercontent.com/googlecartographer/cartographer_toyota_hsr/master/cartographer_toyota_hsr.rosinstall
    wstool update

    # Install deb dependencies.
    rosdep update
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=${ROS_DISTRO} -y

    # Build and install.
    catkin_make_isolated --install --use-ninja
    source install_isolated/setup.bash

Running the demo
================

Once you've completed setup, do the following::

  # Get an HSR .bag file.
  wget -P ~/Downloads https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cartographer-hsr/cartographer_hsr_example.bag
  # Run the demo. This will start rviz and play the bag file automatically.
  roslaunch cartographer_toyota_hsr hsr_demo.launch bag_filename:=${HOME}/Downloads/cartographer_hsr_example.bag
